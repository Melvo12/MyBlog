Cybersecurity is a fascinating and crucial field in today’s world, where technology is deeply integrated into our daily lives. My interest in this topic began while studying Data Analytics and learning about the importance of securing information. I decided I didn’t just want to understand data—I wanted to ensure it was protected from the threats that exist in the digital world.

Throughout my cybersecurity training, I’ve learned to use protection tools and threat analysis, manage vulnerabilities, and understand the core principles of information security. My first cybersecurity course taught me how to identify and prevent common attacks like phishing, and how to secure networks and systems.

On this blog, I’ll share the resources that have helped me in my learning journey and talk about my experiences on platforms like TryHackMe, where I’ve worked on cybersecurity labs and enhanced my technical skills.

If you're interested in the world of cybersecurity or just starting out like I did, I hope this space will be helpful for you.
