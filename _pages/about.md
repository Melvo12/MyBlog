Hello! I'm Daniel Ricketts, a tech enthusiast passionate about cybersecurity and software development. My journey hasn't been linear; I started with a degree in Biology from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. However, I've always been intrigued by how technology can transform any field, including science. Over the years, my interest in data analytics and software development grew, which led me to study Google’s Data Analytics Specialization. Later, I decided to broaden my horizons by learning web development and, more recently, specializing in cybersecurity. On this blog, I’ll share my experience, my projects, and everything I’ve learned about development, data analysis, and cybersecurity.
